Computing Project For Goldsmiths

Greetings to anyone reading this, this is a compact react + express project. 
There could be some dependencies that might be disrupted: 
To remove any confusion there should be two terminals one for backend and one for frontend.


For backend 
cd backend
npm install --force

For front end
cd ../frontend/barber-app
npm install --force

For backend 
cd backend
node . or nodemon .

For front end
cd frontend/barber-app
npm start# BarberApp
